## This was the final version of a web app written in Java EE for my group's Enterprise Systems Development module assignment in final year of university.

This is probably the code I'm least proud of. It was our first foray into Java EE and was cobbled together in about 48 hours before the deadline in a group of 4, with little sleep in that period.

Take a look through the code and you will see stunning violations of the MVC pattern, gaping security holes (that "login" method...) and no best practice whatsoever.

But hey, it worked - in that it rendered a web page you could interact with, and passed the pre-defined tests of the module leader. Had they not told us these tests in advance, we would have been screwed. But upon realising we wouldn't implement a fully working system in time, we devoted most of our efforts to hacking together a solution that would game the tests.

I learnt an incredible amount from the project nonetheless; a little about Java EE and JSPs, a hell of a lot about multi-branch git development and working in a coding team in general (first experience), what the MVC pattern is, how data is passed amongst the various components of an enterprise web app, and plenty in-between.
