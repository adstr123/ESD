## This was the final version of a web app written in Java EE for my group's Enterprise Systems Development module assignment in final year of university.

This was our first foray into Java EE and was produced in a short period (~48 hours )in a group of 4. Also our first exposure to multi-branch Git development.

Due to the short time period and lack of experience, the code is somewhat unrefined. Violations of the MVC pattern and some gaping security holes remained at submission time.

But it worked - it generated a web page you could interact with, and passed the set of tests performed by the module leader. I learnt an incredible amount from the project; a little about Java EE and JSPs, a lot about multi-branch git development and working in a coding team in general, what the MVC pattern is, how data is passed amongst the various components of an enterprise web app, and plenty in-between.
